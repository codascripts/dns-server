DNS Server Challenge

This project is a DNS server implementation that parses and creates DNS packets, responds to DNS queries, and handles various DNS record types. It also performs recursive resolution. The goal of this challenge was to understand the DNS protocol, packet format, and implement core components such as root servers, authoritative servers, and forwarding servers.

Key Features:
    DNS Query Parsing: Handles DNS query packets.
    Record Handling: Supports A, AAAA, CNAME, and other record types.
    Recursive Resolution: Resolves domain names through a series of DNS lookups.
    Root and Authoritative Servers: Implements behavior for root servers and authoritative servers.

Technologies Used:
    Programming Language: Java
    Networking: UDP, DNS Protocol
